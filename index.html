Adams is wearing a dark jacket and a white shirt, and the open shirt collar is spread over the lapel of his jacket.

            “At one with the power of the American landscape, and renowned for
            the patient skill and timeless beauty of his work (see Ansel Adams
            Yosemite black and white photographs and original prints),
            photographer Ansel Adams has been a visionary in his efforts to
            preserve this country's wild and scenic areas, both on film and on
            Earth. Drawn to the beauty of nature's monuments, he is regarded by
            environmentalists as a monument himself, and by photographers as a
            national institution. It is through his foresight and fortitude that
            so much of America has been saved for future Americans.”
